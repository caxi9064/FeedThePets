- I've personally never used Angular or SQL, which are going to be used for our FrontEnd and BackEnd architecture, respectively
- These basic tutorials should hopefully shed some light on the process of both Angular and SQL

Angular Tutorials:
	1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ1mlcCkY8A
	2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5E2AVpwsko
- Angular is being used for our front end architecture
	- Mostly based using HTML and TypeScript (can use JavaScript though)
	- Typescript: varies from Javasript
		- Has interface while JavsScript does not have an interface
	- Launch the app through boostrapping

SQL Tutorials:
	1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pzj7Aj25lw
- SQL is being used for our BackEnd architecture
	- Accepts client requests and processes the date, responds to the request
		- Would be good for Feed the Pets, accepts users request and reponds with an updated feeding schedule, etc.
	- GUI and command based
	- SQL server creates and maintains databases, perfect multiple users maintaining a schedule
